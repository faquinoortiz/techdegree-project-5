# techdegree-project-5 - Public API Request

This project creates a directory for 12 random employees at the company Awesome Startup. The information is fetched from a random user API (https://randomuser.me/documentation) 
which includes name, employee picture, email and city and state of residence. The user can also select an employee this will prompt a modal window that will provide previous noted information plus some additional
information such as:

- Street Address
- Birthday
- Phone Number

The user is then able to use the "Prev"(Previous) and "Next" buttons on the modal to navigate between employees. Once the employee is done with their navigation, they can close out of 
their modal screen utilizing the "X".
